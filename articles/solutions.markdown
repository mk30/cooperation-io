# Coming up with creative solutions

How do we come up with solutions to problems that work in today's world? What kinds of dynamics do we have to think about in which the solutions that we come up with must swim?

##Dynamics

Constant change: that's it folks! Things will just keep changing forever. You can't count on things to stay the same anymore for any period of time. it seems absurd to plan for 5 years from now. can you honestly say that you have any idea what the world will look like in 5 years?

##Solutions

Anti-fragility is a helpful concept. What does anti-fragility mean? Anti-fragile systems are systems that get stronger when they encounter problems, difficulties, and challenges. The immune system is an anti-fragile system - after it deals with an infection, it becomes stronger forever. Our solutions must not ony be resilient but must in fact get stronger when they confront challenges. 

Be inspired by biological metaphors. I love this alan kay talk where he says about the internet: since it started, it's never been turned off. it's now a billion times bigger than when it started. no element of the internet now existed when it started. do you know what kinds of systems operate like this? biological systems.

The first step is to invert your thinking from "how do i get from the current world to the world i want" into "if i could solve this problem from scratch, how would i do it? what would a system look like that would address the problem that we have?" Then work backwards. What will we need to create, what dependencies do we need to solve, in order to create the solution that works correctly.

Ctrl-C Ctrl-V: Always think of solutions that can be easily adapted for use by others.

Humanity: We can no longer settle for anything less than the ability of every human to live their lives in a way that allows them to realize and explore to their maximum ability what they are capable of.

P2P: Hierarchy is no longer acceptable in any of the ways that we do things. There is no room for it. We do not tolerate it. Any solution that involves hierarchy will no longer work.
